=> Predict_Student_Grades
A simple Machine Learning project that predicts a student’s exam score based on the number of study hours.

=>Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Linear Regression — one of the most basic ML algorithms — to find the relationship between study hours and exam scores.

=>Goal
Predict a student’s score if they study for X hours.

=>Technologies Used
Python 
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)


=>Key Steps
Import and explore dataset
Visualize data (scatter plot)
Train Linear Regression model
Test the model with new inputs
Evaluate performance (MAE, R² Score)
